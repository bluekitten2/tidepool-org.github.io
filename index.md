# Tidepool Developer Portal

This is Tidepool's developer microsite. If you are looking for our company web site, please visit [tidepool.org](https://tidepool.org).

We are building an internet application platform and series of applications to help reduce the burden of managing Type 1 Diabetes. We're a nonprofit organization doing everything in the open. Open source, open business, and we need lots of help.

This is a microsite for helping to guide and manage the open source nature of our work. Its intended audience is software developers who are interested in helping us continuously improve the way we serve the Type 1 Diabetes community.

This is a work in progress. If you find something particularly confusing, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tidepool-org.github.io/issues) with suggestions on how it could be clearer.

## Getting started

1. Read about [ways you can help](how-to-help).
1. Read through the [use cases](use-cases) we're trying to solve for.
1. Read about the [technical vision](platform-overview) that informs our software architecture. See our [platform roadmap](platform-roadmap).
1. Read about our [server architecture](server-architecture) and [server data model](server-data-organization). These pages tell how the many moving parts of our server system fit together, and how the various bits of server data is organized. These documents do not talk about the medical data specifically; they're more about the user data and metadata.
1. Read our [data formats](data-model/v1) documentation to understand what medical data we can track and how it's organized.
1. Read about [our plan for the Tidepool Query Language](queries-and-notifications) and [its implementation JSON format](query-implementation).

Once you're done with all that reading, you're ready to dive into the code! Visit the [Tidepool components](tidepool-components) page to see the active repositories and how they fit together.

To get the stack running on your own machine, see the [Starting Services](starting-up-services) page.

If you're looking for reference info, check out [our references page](references).

If you want to contribute work back to us (and we hope you do!), you need to agree to our Volunteer/Contributor License Agreement (VCLA). See [the Contributors page](contributors) for more info.

## Communicating with the team

Since our team spans the globe, there's nearly always someone in the #tidepool IRC channel on freenode.net. Feel free to pop in there and engage with us.

We intend to but have not yet set up mailing lists for development. When we do, we'll put the information here. In the meantime, please feel free to drop a note to [info@tidepool.org](mailto://info@tidepool.org), and it will find the right recipient quickly.

*Thank you for your support.*
