#Tidepool Developer Portal

We are building an internet application platform and series of applications to help reduce the burden of managing Type 1 Diabetes. We're a nonprofit organization doing everything in the open. Open source, open business, and we need lots of help.

This is a microsite for helping to guide and manage the open source nature of our work. Its intended audience is software developers who are interested in helping us continuously improve the way we serve the Type 1 Diabetes community.

This is a work in progress. If you find something particularly confusing, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tidepool-org.github.io/issues) with suggestions on how it could be clearer.

## Getting started

1. Read about [ways you can help](HowToHelp.html).
2. Read through the [use cases](UseCases.html) we're trying to solve for.
3. Read about the [technical vision](PlatformOverview.html) that informs our software architecture.
4. Read about our [server architecture](ServerArchitecture.html) and [server data model](ServerDataOrganization.html). These pages tell how the many moving parts of our server system fit together, and how the various bits of server data is organized.

Once you're done with all that reading, you're ready to dive into the code! Visit the [Tidepool components](TidepoolComponents.html) page to see the active repositories and how they fit together.

To get the stack running on your own machine, see the [Starting Services](StartingUpServices.html) page.

If you're looking for reference info, check out [our references page](References.html).

If you want to contribute work back to us (and we hope you do!), you need to sign a Contributor's License Agreement (CLA). See [the Contributors page](Contributors.html) for more info.

## Communicating with the team

Since our team spans the globe, there's nearly always someone in the #tidepool IRC channel on freenode.net. Feel free to pop in there and engage with us.

We intend to but have not yet set up mailing lists for development. When we do, we'll put the information here. In the meantime, please feel free to drop a note to [info@tidepool.org](mailto://info@tidepool.org), and it will find the right recipient quickly.

*Thank you for your support.*
