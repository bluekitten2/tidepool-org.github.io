#Tidepool Developer Portal

We are building an internet application platform and series of applications to help reduce the burden of managing Type 1 Diabetes. We're a nonprofit organization doing everything in the open. Open source, open business, and we need lots of help.

This is a microsite for helping to guide and manage the open source nature of our work. Its intended audience is software developers who are interested in helping us continuously improve the way we serve the Type 1 Diabetes community.

This is a work in progress. If you find something particularly confusing, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/tidepool-org/tidepool-org.github.io/issues) with suggestions on how it could be clearer.


#Technical Documentation

We're beginning to organize the documentation and the projects in a way we hope other people will be able to find useful. 

The docs that developers will spend most of their time with are located in the [Tidepool Component List](TidepoolComponents.html), which documents the active repositories and how they fit together.
## Communicating with the team

If this is your first time getting exposed to Tidepool, however, we recommend reading through the following pages first.
Since our team spans the globe, there's nearly always someone in the #tidepool IRC channel on freenode.net. Feel free to pop in there and engage with us.

[Use Cases](UseCases.html) is a high-level list of use cases we're attempting to solve for. It needs more work, and it needs to be backed up with greater detail.
We intend to but have not yet set up mailing lists for development. When we do, we'll put the information here. In the meantime, please feel free to drop a note to [info@tidepool.org](mailto://info@tidepool.org), and it will find the right recipient quickly.

The [Platform Overview](PlatformOverview.html) tries to explain our technical vision in the near term, with heavy emphasis on the things we're implementing right now. 

The [Server Architecture](ServerArchitecture.html) page tells how the many moving parts of our server system fit together. 

The [Server Data Organization](ServerDataOrganization.html) page explains how the various bits of server data is organized and how they relate to each other. It also has a set of use cases we try to keep in mind, but they're still sparse. They'll someday get a page of their own.
*Thank you for your support.*
