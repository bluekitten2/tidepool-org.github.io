#About the Tidepool Project

We are building an internet application platform and series of applications to help reduce the burden of managing Type 1 Diabetes. See [our web site](http://tidepool.org) for lots and lots of information about the project.


#How you can help

We're a nonprofit organization doing everything in the open. Open source, open business, and we need lots of help. [This document](HowToHelp.html) will give you a pretty detailed overview of the sorts of ways people can help. 

#Technical Documentation

We're beginning to organize the documentation and the projects in a way we hope other people will be able to find useful. 

The docs that developers will spend most of their time with are located in the [Tidepool Component List](TidepoolComponents.html), which documents the active repositories and how they fit together.

If this is your first time getting exposed to Tidepool, however, we recommend reading through the following pages first.

[Use Cases](UseCases.html) is a high-level list of use cases we're attempting to solve for. It needs more work, and it needs to be backed up with greater detail.

The [Platform Overview](PlatformOverview.html) tries to explain our technical vision in the near term, with heavy emphasis on the things we're implementing right now. 

The [Server Architecture](ServerArchitecture.html) page tells how the many moving parts of our server system fit together. 

The [Server Data Organization](ServerDataOrganization.html) page explains how the various bits of server data is organized and how they relate to each other. It also has a set of use cases we try to keep in mind, but they're still sparse. They'll someday get a page of their own.
