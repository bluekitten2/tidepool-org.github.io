This is a Tidepool microsite for helping to guide and manage the open source nature of our work. 

This is a GitHub Pages site, and the deployed site can be found [here](http://tidepool-org.github.io).

If you want to run it locally, you should have a Ruby installation working.

Then do ```gem install bundle``` from within this repository.

To render the site, do ```bundle exec jekyll server --watch```, then visit http://localhost:4000 in your browser. 

While that's running, you can then edit the site, save the result, and reload the web page to see it on your local site.
