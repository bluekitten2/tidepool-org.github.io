##Making Contributions

If you are working on your own behalf would like to submit a pull request (and are not on this list), you must agree to [our CLA](TidepoolCLA.pdf) and you will be added to the list. To agree, please post on GitHub -- either in the issue that addresses your pull request or the pull request itself -- the following text:

> I agree to the terms of Tidepool Project's Contributor License Agreement 
> as it exists at http://tidepool-org.github.io/TidepoolCLA.pdf on <TODAY'S DATE>.

Please make sure that one of Tidepool's employees (see below) sees it and adds you to the list.

If your contributions are on behalf of a company or you need to get your company's permission to contribute, please have your company fill out the [corporate CLA](TidepoolCorporateCLA.pdf) and submit it to us. (NOTE -- that link is broken while we wait to get the actual CLA.)

##Committers
