# List of Tidepool Components

The following list of Tidepool components constitutes a sort of guided tour of the important repositories of code that Tidepool is managing. It will be an ever-changing list (last updated 12 May 2014), so please feel free to return often to see it updated. Eventually we'll be generating it straight from our repositories. 

A hint: if you look at the [main github page for Tidepool](https://github.com/tidepool-org), the repositories are sorted in order of the most recent commit. Generally that will be a pretty good hint as to which repositories are under active development -- and anything further down than page 2 is probably inactive.
