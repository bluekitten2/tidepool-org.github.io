This document describes the v1 Tidepool data formats.  Well, a sub-set of them right now, anyway.  But it will have all of them soon.

All events in the tidepool platform are JSON formatted.  They all share a "type" field that defines the type of the event.  The semantics of the other fields in the events are generally defined individually per type, but there are some common fields defined below.

## Common Fields

### time

An ISO8601 timestamp with a timezone.

### deviceId

An indication of the device that generated the datum.  This should be globally unique.  A device make and model with serial number is a good value to include here.

### source

The original source of the data.  This is something like `diasend` if the data came from Diasend, `carelink` if from Carelink, `device` if it came directly from a device, etc.

This is primarily used for annotative and informational purposes.

## Units

The Tidepool platform processes blood glucose data in `mg/dL` format.  We chose `mg/dL` instead of `mmol/L` because `mg/dL` is an integer and dealing with integers generally avoids weird behaviors that can arise from working with floating point numbers.  While the likelihood of `mmol/L` actually causing any of those is admittedly low, neither unit is necessarily "better" than the other and this "reason" provided a tie breaker for the decision.

Most event types that include a blood glucose reading can also have a units field specified.  When that field is `mmol/L`, we will convert the value to `mg/dL` and store the result.  The units field will be preserved, but the numerical values will all be in `mg/dL`.  The algorithm followed for conversion is

1. If units field exists and is `mmol/L`
2. Check the value, if below 39 convert
3. Multiply the value by 18.0182
4. Floor away any values after the decimal point

If you have a case where you are worried about legitimately generated BG values above 40 in `mmol/L`, the HTTP API allows you to attach a query parameter `noUnitConversion` to your event submission.  When this is set, the conversion algorithm will be skipped with the expectation that you have already done the conversion.
