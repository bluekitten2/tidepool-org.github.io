Styx is a service that uses hakken to discover services and route requests. It is essentially a software load balancer, but it integrates with hakken (and can be extended to integrate with other service discovery mechanisms) to find services. It also allows for integration with an authentication layer and intelligent forwarding, like consistent hashing. It is intended as a front-tier layer for a backend API.
