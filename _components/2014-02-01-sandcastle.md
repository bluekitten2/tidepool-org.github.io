This repository is no longer being actively developed.

Sandcastle uses the version control system git as a storage base. Blocks of data can be sent to sandcastle and they are then stored in git in a special repository unique to each user. Future changes to that data are stored as revisions in git, meaning that the state of the data and all changes to it (the provenance) are tracked. A future benefit is that an interested user could clone and manage their personal git repository.
