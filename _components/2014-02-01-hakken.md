Hakken provides a mechanism for services to find one another without having to store configuration information in each service. It also allows multiple copies of each service (including hakken itself). Hakken has one or more coordinators that communicate with one another to maintain a common list of other services. The services register themselves with hakken as they wake up. When and if they disappear, hakken will eventually notice the fact and remove them from the registry.
