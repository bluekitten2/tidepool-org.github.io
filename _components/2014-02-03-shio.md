Shio operates by combining "deployable tarballs" with "config tarballs" and running the application. Shio has two main concepts: servers and slots. Servers are the physical machines that you deploy to. Slots are deployment slots that exist on servers for deployment. You can have multiple different slots on the same server and deploy different things to that one server.
