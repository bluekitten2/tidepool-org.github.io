My forays into installing tidepool according to instructions at http://developer.tidepool.io/starting-up-services/ -- intended as a proof-of-concept.  No guarantees of speed, reliability, or usability (though everything seems to indicate that it is usable speed when rendered in chrome):

a) -Install linux prerequisites that come as packages: git, bzr used apt-cache search <keyword> for exact name
b) -Installed node.js using instructions at http://joshondesign.com/2013/10/23/noderpi (actually ended up using package method of http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/ )
c) -installed  node-gyp, bower, grunt-cli, gulp, mocha using sudo npm install -g <package>
d) -Increased swap file to 1GB according to these instructions http://lokir.wordpress.com/2012/10/13/raspberry-pi-debian-how-to-change-swap-size/ -- not sure this was needed
e) -Installed go on raspberry pi from http://dave.cheney.net/unofficial-arm-tarballs  
f) -Github SSH - Installed an ssh key from my raspberry pi for github using these instructions https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys 
g) -Mongo DB was installed by cloning ArduPi from https://github.com/brice-morin/ArduPi -- this has precompiled mongodb binaries in a directory with instructions (avoided having to compile hopefully) and followed these instructions https://github.com/brice-morin/ArduPi/tree/master/mongodb-rpi/linux-test
      -made directory /data/db and made sure to start mongod pointed to this directory since it is what tidepool expects
      -tested with web tests from point 6 -- mongodb version is 2.1.1 -- does it really matter?  NO!
h) -consulted tidepool support to find out that blip and jellyfish required git checkouts of v0.1.2.7 and v0.2.4 respectivly in their directories, followed by a npm install for each (version current as of September 17, 2014, may not apply when you read this)
i) -was finally able to execute . tools/runservers and waited for 7-10 minutes for framework to install and run
      -tested blip and jellyfish by going to http://localhost:3000 and http://localhost:3004 respectively -- success
