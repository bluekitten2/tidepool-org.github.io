#Technical Reference materials

This page is for holding useful links.

##Tidepool-internal Links

[API User Guide](/tidepool-api)
: An attempt at a usage-oriented guide to the Tidepool API. Still a work in progress, but we hope it's useful.

[Tidepool Data Formats](/data-model/v1)
: Defines the data structures we store and how they're organized.

[Tidepool components](/tidepool-components)
: Contains the active list of Tidepool components and repositories.

[Getting Started](/starting-up-services)
: The place you should look if you're trying to get the Tidepool software stack running.

[Metrics Glossary](/metrics-glossary)
: This is the glossary of terms used in our metrics reporting. Mostly useful internally, but someday we may be able to share all the information coming from our metrics.
